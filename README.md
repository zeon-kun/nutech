## Setting Up the Project

Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project (if it doesn't exist) and populate it with the required configuration variables.

```
# env.example
DATABASE_URL="<your_postgresql_url>"
PORT=3010
NODE_ENV=dev
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="<your_domains>"
JWT_SECRET="<your-secret-key>"
UPLOAD_DIR="uploads"

POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=nutechdb
```

For a clean local development environment, you only need the database running. You will run the Node.js application directly on your host machine using npm run dev

You can use the docker-compose.dev.yml provided in this project to run your own postgresql instance
